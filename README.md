# Alongside Take Home Project: UniswapX + uAssets
Context: Universal is on a mission to close the gap between a CEX and a DEX. We built wrapped assets to bridge the liquidity gap. Now, we want to combine that with the speed, performance, and execution of a CEX.   



Task: Architect and implement a backend for a new exchange that uses Uniswap X as the settlement layer and uAssets as assets on exchange. 



You are not expected to build an entire exchange. Feel free to focus on the parts you think best showcase your abilities and relevance. We will assume every candidate is using AI.



Submit a link to the repo with a spec and code.
